# A new language based on C++ using LLVM for IR
Created a new language entirely using C++, with the backend handled by LLVM. This programming language is heavily inspired by C++, Haskell and Jai. It is an imperative static/strongly typed C-style language. The front-end is custom-written, namely a Lexer, Parser and a lazy AST system.
